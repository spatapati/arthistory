It\'s also hollow and bronze, which was very classical. David beat Goliath as the underdog with God\'s help, and Florentines identified with that because they too beat the Duke of Milan, ostensibly with God\'s help. So David symbolizes Florence, in a way.

The oranges in the picture also symvolize wealth. The people portrayed in the painting also don\'t have shoes on, which might imply that something sacred was going on, maybe their wedding.
